What do we need to trust each other? Lots of time? No. I coached teams where people were working for years and still didn’t trust each other and feel safe and confident to give honest feedback. What we learnt from Google’s project Aristotle is that a high performance team member needs first psychological safety in the team to create effectiveness. It’s easier to apply yourself for offering new ideas, to express your real opinion and to trust yourself to take risks if you know your teammates won’t blame or punish you for your mistakes.
