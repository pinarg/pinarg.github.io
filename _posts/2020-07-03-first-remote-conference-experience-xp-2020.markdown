First Remote Conference Experience: XP 2020
The Coronavirus Pandemic took my job away. At the same time, it gave me the opportunity to gain my first experience of working with remote teams and attending remote conferences and meet-ups.
## My Impressions of XP 2020
This was my second time at XP and -like the first time- it was full of great speakers, workshops and keynotes.
## Psychologic Safety
One of them was the session by Marcin Floryan (Spotify) as part of the Leadership Track who talked about “How to create a safe environment — practically”
His talk discussed how to make every employee feel safe and comfortable and give them a voice so that they can talk easily about failure, discuss real problems and be creative.
Together, with his colleagues in the playback tribe, they developed a great psychological safety toolkit that helps you find out how to make your team members easily ask questions, raise problems, disagree, take risks, make mistakes and be themselves.
Marcin’s Psychologic Safety toolkit will inspire you.

## Why does Psychologic Safety matter?
Looking for a new job and having job interviews at the moment made me realise that lots of companies need to understand the difference between doing Agile and Being Agile.
I often get asked in job interviews
What would you say when your boss asks you after a year working as a Scrum Master why your team doesn’t perform?
How do you convince employees who are against moving to Agile?
What would you do when your team makes a decision in the absence of a team member who comes in the next day and doesn’t agree with the decision of the entire team?
The team always has long, unnecessary discussions and can’t make decisions easily and doesn’t keep discussion within the time box. What would you do?
There‘s a tension between the development team and management because they’re not satisfied with the velocity delivered by team. What would you do?
During my experience as a Scrum Master in the last four years I learnt that people don’t agree with team decisions because they don’t trust their colleagues. Furthermore they have long discussions and don’t want to make decisions because they have personal conflicts with each other. They make you think they have problems with the suggested solutions but actually there is nothing wrong and it’s the personal issues that get in the way. People don’t feel safe to ask questions and give honest feedback. They can’t be innovative because they are too scared to try out something new. The culture of learning from making mistakes doesn’t exist.
If you are familiar with these symptoms within your teams then you should consider the psychological safety aspects.
## Radical Innovation
Another interesting presentation was held by Anders Haugeto (Iterate) about “Radical innovation” in the same Leadership Track.
“Agility is not about process and tools — it’s about creating positive change.” he says.
Anders presented the idea that you can enable radical innovation. We should stop judging people‘s ideas in our organisations and let them grow instead.
Companies often set up strategies first and only support the ideas that fit in and then they get stuck into them. Should we not explore first what’s really needed and then set up the strategy on the basis of this learning?

**You know the steps from right to left ;)**

You know the steps from right to left :D
It was also amazing to hear that you can decide whether you want to be an introvert or an extrovert company :) Being an extroverted company means that you create value for customers with a disruptor’s mindset and radical ideas.

In my own experience I see companies trying to keep implementing a framework although some parts of it do not match with the needs of some teams any more. One example is the release planning part of the SAFe framework. Release planing can make sense when all the teams depend on one another. But there are teams without such dependencies and they are often forced to wait until the next release planning session to plan the next iteration.
Although the conference was online I met new cool people and old friends during the breaks facilitated by Frederik Vannieuwenhuyse using Liberating Structures and via the Hallway discussion forum “Gather Town”. Another nice tool I learned about is menti.com for getting real-time feedback.
Of course, no one could stop me from meeting old good friends who also attended the XP 2020 for an online after-conference beer :)

It was fun and hope to see guys next year.
Take care of yourself, stay safe and healthy.
