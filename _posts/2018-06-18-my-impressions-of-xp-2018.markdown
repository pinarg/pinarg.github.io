International Conference on Agile Software Development

XP 2018 took place in Porto, Portugal this year with really amazing workshops, sessions and awesome keynote speakers. On Monday, first day of conference, I joined my first workshop which was one of my highlights.
it was called “Learning Fast — Essentials for Company-Wide Agilit” by Jutta Eckstein and John Buck.

In the workshop I got to know the framework BOSSA nova, which means in Portuguese “new wave”.

It is a synthesis of four streams: B = Beyond Budgeting, OS = Open Space, S= Sociocracy A = Agile

The interpretation of four values from the Agile Manifesto for a BOSSA nova company looks like Transparency, Self-organization, Continuous Learning and Constant Customer Focus.
Only using Scrum won’t make your company Agile, so you can benefit from all BOSSA streams. Company-Wide Agility with using BOSSA nova means “being on a journey without a final destination.”

If you want to change the culture in your company it is not enough only to change the strategy — you should also change the processes and the structures. And every change regarding to any aspect in this triangle (picture on the left) will have an impact on others.

And I was also very impressed from the idea “new organigram”. The new ogranigram shows an organisation which is value centered. In contrast to the traditional organigrams you have your defined value in the core of your organization, not at the bottom.

Especially it was amazing to get to know Jutta Eckstein who is a great moderator and speaker.

Another great session was “Fighting the bear” by Sergey Shcherbinin.

Sergey’s talk was about how a traditional bank in Russia succeed with the Agile transformation. They founded a transformation team with CEO playing the role Product Owner and the team put the action items in the backlog for the transformation and the members of this team decided the next steps for the process. The most important things for managing the transformation which he mentioned were widest possible communication and consistency on all levels in the organization. And they invested a lot in people for their Scrum training, team coaching, personal coaching and team building activities.
And here we are, me with Kent Beck :)

In his keynote speech he spoke mostly about diversity and discrimination based on color, accent and gender. The other topic was: cheap experimentation. Before you start to adapt something for the entire company make some cheap experiments to find out the effect.
I really enjoyed the conference and the company of amazing participants in beautiful Porto.
