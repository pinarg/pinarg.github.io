[Liberating Structures (LS)](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/) are 33 microstructures for facilitating meetings dynamically and making sure everybody in the group participates in the discussion.
After attending a LS User Group event in Hamburg facilitated by [Johannes Schartau](http://johannes.schartau.eu/), I was pretty amazed how it was possible to have everyone from a huge group participating in the discussion, gathering data, generating insights and deciding what to do.

LS are very easy to implement. The very well explained descriptions of each structure on the website helps you to find out which structure is suitable for your meeting and how to run and combine it with other microstructures.
After observing some great retrospectives facilitated with LS I also decided to use this great framework for my own retrospectives.

I combined a classic retrospective agenda with one of my favorite LS [W3 — What, So What, Now What?](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w/) for “looking back together with my team on progress to date and deciding what adjustments are needed”.
My retrospective agenda looked like this:

- Check-in
- Happiness Radar
- What? So What? Now What?
- Check-out

“What?” I used as question for gathering data about the observations since last retro. In the second part “So What” I wanted my team to answer the questions for “Why?” — “Why is that important? What patterns or conclusions are emerging?” and then we kept going with the last question “Now What” to decide what to do.

The biggest benefit using LS is that you can make sure that everyone participates in the discussion rather than just having a few people from the team take over the whole discussion and decision making. The LS work especially well for running retrospectives of big teams.

Have fun with experiencing the LS for your next retrospective.

Happy Easter.
