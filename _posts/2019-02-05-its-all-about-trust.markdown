What do we need to trust each other? Lots of time? No. I coached teams where people were working for years and still didn’t trust each other and feel safe and confident to give honest feedback. What we learnt from [Google’s project Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/) is that a high performance team member needs first psychological safety in the team to create effectiveness. It’s easier to apply yourself for offering new ideas, to express your real opinion and to trust yourself to take risks if you know your teammates won’t blame or punish you for your mistakes.  
Let’s have a look at scrum values and I’ll try to explain why you can’t teach your team to live these values if you -first of all-as a scrum master are not able to help people to work in an environment with physiological safety and to make them trust each other.

## Courage

“Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems” if they work in a team culture where “make mistakes” get respected and understood.
Openness
“The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work” and there is no need to feel ashamed if the Scrum team doesn’t achieve its goals. The Scrum team deals openly with its failures and takes the responsibility to find out how to improve its processes. “Inspect and Adapt”

## Respect
“Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.” Respect requires honesty and a feedback culture which can exist in a trusty environment.

## Focus
“Everyone focuses on the work of the sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team” and there is no need to get distracted. We all stand behind the Sprint goal which we all planned together and estimated its items which we pulled into the sprint to achieve our Sprint goals.

## Commitment
“People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.” When you work in a team where is not possible to express your real opinion you won’t be able to commit to the plan you rather will try to fulfil an obligation than to take the responsibility for the plan.

At this point, I’d like to mention Christopher Avery’s “Responsibility Process”

This helps me a lot to explain and teach my team about not giving up and learn how to take the ownership to solve our problems and to use this tool to understand the Scum value “commitment” better and distinguish it from obligation.
Hope you enjoyed reading this blog article. Don’t forget to trust yourself ;)
